# Nudge, Push, Shove.

Changing the nudge settings in Sketch used to require a trip to the terminal. _Used to_. Now you can change those settings easily with a plugin. In addition, there's new hotkeys to make huge nudges if you need to.


## Installation

1. Download the plugin and double-click to install.


## Usage

#### Adjust Nudge Settings
- Navigate to `Plugins` > `Nudge, Push, Shove.` > `Adjust Nudge Settings`.
- Hit `ctrl` + `cmd` + `n` on your keyboard.

### Nudge
- Use your `arrow keys` like normal. Default for this is 1px.

### Push
- Use the `shift` + `arrow keys` like normal. Default for this is 10px.

#### Shove
- Navigate to `Plugins` > `Nudge, Push, Shove.` > `Shove arrow key`.
